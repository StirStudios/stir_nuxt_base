## 📦 Project Structure

- `nuxt.config.ts` — Full config for modules, routing, environment, and build
- `app/app.config.ts` — UI theming, layout, animation, and third-party settings
- `assets/css/main.css` — Tailwind CSS entry point
- `utils/uiVariants.ts` — Custom Nuxt UI material variant tokens

## 🎨 Styling Conventions

- Prefer nested CSS for readability.
- In scoped styles, use `:global(...)` + `:deep(...)` when targeting global theme/state classes.
- Prefer stable class hooks over ARIA/attribute selectors for reusable styling targets.
- Keep `app/assets/css/custom.css` as an import/index file and place new rules in focused partials under `app/assets/css/custom/`.
- If a custom stylesheet grows past roughly 80-120 lines or mixes concerns, split it during the same change.
